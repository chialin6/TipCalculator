## Notes

First ever iOS app in my life! I have never learned Swift before. 
It's a little bit hard to code types of variables, since I've been working with Python for a while.
Besides that, I like the Xcode interface more than Android Studio and especially the UI design to create a new function. (use mouse to drag and drop)
Cannot wait to learn and practice more about iOS app development. :smile:
